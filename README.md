# cute-conversational-chatbot

this bot is here to chat and learn from you (it looks more like a dictionary than a real AI, but I wanted something simple & efficient)

## project setup :
- download the files
- make sure to keep all files in the same folder so keep everything together so it works smoothly

## open the files :
- personally, I used VScode, so open it with whatever program that runs python/json 
- precisely, open both chatbot_final.py and knowledge_base.json : these are the CORE files you need for your bot

## running the chatbot :
- run the Python script by hitting "RUN" in the chatbot_final.py file (this will launch the chatbot ^^)

## easy peasy :
- a notice will appear with everything explained (naming the bot, command 'quit', asking to correct when it doesn't understand,...)

## inspiration :
- cute emojis : "windows button" + .
- tkinter's explanation (GUI part of the program) : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-gui-tkinter/
- a yt video that gave me some line ideas : https://youtu.be/CkkjXTER2KE?si=kIys5UN9dgE0Dlhm

## bla-bla-bla :
so thanks to all of this, you will be able to discuss and type your messages by pressing Send each time (currently, pressing "Enter" won’t send the message, I don't know how to make that possible)
anddd, the good point in all of this is that if your chatbot doesn’t know how to reply, you can teach it! it will then remember the answer and re-use when it is asked again by the user (that's why the .json file exist "knowledge_base.json" ;) )

also, sorry for my messy coding... I put personal comments everywhere
however, I tried to be as neutral as possible in the "chatbot_final.py", even tho I also put my draft one and well... hahaha let's not talk about it (but it's just for you to see how I followed up a yt tutorial by mixing it with my own knowledge by explaining line by line each function)

it is not the most perfect chatbot coded in python ever, but I just wanted to try how it could work

### of course you are absolutely free to re-use it and re-style it as you need and wish :)




a pleasure!
